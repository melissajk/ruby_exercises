Many people complain about the ‘cost’ of healthy foods, fresh vegetables,
supplements and proactive health treatments, like regular visits to the doctor
or massages.  If you think of it as a ‘cost’, of course it’s going to seem like
a burden to pay it.  So, don’t think of it as a cost.

Think of it as an investment.  

When you take that little bit of money out of your salary for savings,
you don’t think of that as a cost or a burden, do you?

NO - because you plan to get it back eventually!

And that’s exactly how you should view an investment in your health. 

What you spend now on healthy foods, supplements and proactive treatments, 
will be returned to you in the form of a higher quality of life,
an increase in productivity and, maybe even money….
